 Throughout this paper, we will describe the billions of tons of annual solid waste that are generated globally, along with the problem this poses. In addition, we will discuss the technological innovation that is deep learning using artificial intelligence. We will then discuss the potential uses of AI in the solid waste management industry as an opportunity to remove the human element from waste sorting and streamline the process. This paper will explore the usage of artificial intelligence-based sensor technology regarding waste management as an effective and sustainable means of sorting waste and reducing pollution, and its applications in effective recycling. We will examine how this technology can be efficiently implemented in a variety of differing cultures and environments, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Additionally, we will provide an objective analysis of this technologyâ€™s environmental, social, and economic value, based on factors such as sustainability, accessibility, and costs.
