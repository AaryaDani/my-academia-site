Hello, I’m **Aarya Dani**, a Chemical Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh. In Summer 2024, I interned at **Johnson & Johnson**, where I developed Hugo-based websites to visualize and communicate complex data. I'm currently a **Vaccine Manufacturing Co-Op at Merck**, where I apply my engineering background to real-world production environments. I’m passionate about merging engineering, data science, and user-centered design to drive innovation and impact.
